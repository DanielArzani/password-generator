# Random Password Generator

## Purpose

To create a random password comprised of any combination of uppercase/lowercase characters, numbers and symbols

## Why this is important?

Think of your passwords as your digital keys. They open the door to your personal digital life, including your networks of friends and colleagues, contacts, photos, videos, emails, and even banking and payment details. This is why you should use strong passwords that can’t be easily hacked instead of weak passwords.

Examples of weak passwords are those that feature common words, include your well-known personal information, or are less than eight characters long. Hackers don’t need to expend much effort to crack these types of passwords.

The aim of this password generator is to create strong secure passwords that can't be hacked.
